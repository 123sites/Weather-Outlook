# Weather-Outlook-For-Travel
## Description ✏️

- Acceptance Criteria
I made an online daily planner for the work day schedule from 9 am to 5 pm.  Below is a list of its features.

1) Open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
2) Scroll down, presented with timeblocks by business time.
3) Timeblocks for that day color-coded, past, present, future.
4) Click into a timeblock, can enter an event.
5) Click save button for that timeblock, event text saved to LS.
6) When I refresh the page, saved events are there.

- Additional features:
1) I added that the save button changes color, while hovering on it.
2) Also, while on a given day, you will see that the box you are on has a solid line.  The other boxes have dashed lines, so you know where you are on your planner.
